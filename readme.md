## Project Brief

You are to design, build, deploy, and present an application built for a real
world customer. Find a business or organisation nearby to Coder Academy to build
an application for. Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find
out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an
application and present your ideas to the client.

## Business Problem

The current problem faced by Akira, owner of Japanese knife shop Tanto is all
reporting is done manually via Microsoft Excel. This process can be both
time-consuming and tedious, and time management is of the essence when running a
business. These are some of the processes that are done via Excel

* Customer Traffic
* Stock Lists
* Sales, Net Profit, Customer graphs
* Sales
* Customer Information
* Rostering
* Promotional & Reminder emails

## Solution

The solution that we have come up with collectively is an application that can
automate most of the work that Akira does on a weekly basis manually on Excel.
Create a user interface which is elegant and straightforward where any user such
as an employee can use.

## Post Project Review

## Collaboration as a team

We all thoroughly enjoyed working as a team. All of us had different strengths
and weaknesses but work through them together. All decisions were made as a team
such as wireframes, implementation of features and how to approach challenges.
We learned how to use Github effectively throughout the project with minimal
conflicts.

## Challenges

* When we first did our two-day hackathon as a group, we used Slack as our
  primary source of combining code through copy and paste. This time around we
  decided to use Github because of the large-scale code that had to be merged
  between team members. Being our first time attempting this, we were cautious
  in our merges with conflicts.

* At first, we struggled with data manipulation with nested arrays within
  objects which did take time to master however dealing with it so often has
  enhanced our skills.

* Business owners and programmers have different thought processes which we came
  to realise through many situations where there were differing views on
  features.

## Future plans

After initially seeing our deployed application, the client was delighted with
the result and wanted use to implement more features. We received an email with
even more request and even though we were able to build some of them, there are
still a few we are planning on implementing. Some of the planned future works
include automated email services when necessary, more intensive reports that can
be manipulated and customised, statistical data in regards to their website and
possibly connecting with the hotel database for the more natural recording of
transactions.
